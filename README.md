# deface_mri (Matlab code)
## Performs defacing of brain MRI for anonymization

This code performs defacing of brain mri by first applying rigid 
 registration and then deforming the mask from BCI-DNI brain

### INPUT: 
 This following code expects that the _subject_.mask.nii.ga and
 _subject_.bfc.nii.gz exist. These files are generated by running
 BrainSuite's first two steps.

 If these files do not exist, then
 first run BrainSuite sequence on the subject MRI till BSE and BFC (the
 first two steps of BrainSuite sequence).
 
### OUTPUT:
 The output is stored at _subject_.deface.mask.nii.gz and _subject_.deface.nii.gz
